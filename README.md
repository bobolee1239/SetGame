# Set Game

### Description:
  * It's my first iOS app to practice MVC model in swift.
  
  * The __rule__ of set game can be checked out [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game))
  
  **_NOTE:_**
>     For convenience, the striped card would be represented by adding transparency for the same 
>     color. 
   
 
  
### Future Work:
  * Customize my own card view to make this a real set game.
